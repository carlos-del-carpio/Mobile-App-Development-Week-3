# Mobile-App-Development-Week-3

This week consisted of 2 projects.

## HW02
This project consisted of a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) level calculator that explored the concepts of multiple View Controllers and passing data between them. The passed data helps calculate the BAC level after a certain amount of time.

## InClass03
Exploring the concept of passing data between ViewControllers, this application furthered that knowledge by updating objects from one view to another and alerting users when data was missing.
